# SOEN341-SA1
Website Project for SOEN 341 : Team SA1

### Team Members:
- Refat Kamal
- Ming Tao Yu
- Jonathan Cournoyer
- Eric Kokmanian
- Kresten Ordekian

### Dev environment:
- Git/Github
- Local: 

1) PHPStorm
    - Refat made an excellent suggestion for PHPStorm. Please download it at: www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students
    - Follow the conversation in Slack, testing pending.

2) XAMPP
    - If PHPStorm does not work for you (Try the sql feature of PHPStorm to see if you can create tables using our .sql query of the repo), here's an alternative solution. This is less user-friendly than Refat's idea, but will get the job done in the worst case scenario. 
    - What is XAMPP: XAMPP is a free open source plateform that will turn your pc into a temporary local server capable of compiling PHP code (PHP can only be run on a server). It also provides you with a local mySQL database backend. 

    - Where to Download: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
    - How to run php with XAMPP https://www.techwalla.com/articles/how-to-run-a-php-file-in-xampp 
    - How to create a mySQL database with XAMPP: https://www.cloudways.com/blog/connect-mysql-with-php/ (Note that the backend code for our website has already been created. Simply copy past the queries found in the .sql file of our SOEN341 repo and execute it on XAMPP to have local testing sql tables.)
    - Why is it worse than PHPStorm: Because it doesn't come with a developer environment to write code in PHP. It just compiles it. You'll need a separate software listed below in order to write codes. 
 

- Remote cloud (Optional): AWS Elastic Beanstalk Application PHP server + MySQL database*. 
  - Sign up for a 12 month free account and read Issues -> TODO: Setup AWS environment for some useful links. 

- Text editor (Mandatory if using XAMPP, optional if using PHPStorm): Sublime Text 3, notepad++ or anything you feel comfortable writing codes in. It doesn't matter what text editors you use as the "compiler" will always be XAMPP

- Link for Sublime Text : https://www.sublimetext.com/

*Note that AWS is optional. You can start developing with just XAMPP + text editor + Git & not everyone needs to have an AWS account. I however recommend looking into AWS if cloud computing interests you. 

### Main languages: 
HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL (alternative to PHP to be discussed, i.e. javascript + node.js) 

### Sprint 1 objectives:

Please see issue tab for comprehensive list

SUMMARY - All team members needs to:
- Clone the master repo, create a new branch, attempt to add your name to the "Team Members" list in the readme of the master branch from the new branch you created through a git "Pull Request" (please feel free to message on slack if you need help for this step). You should then review someone else's pull request and approve it. 
- Setup dev environment with the softwares mentionned above
- Look into the "issue" section of the repo 
- Look into Sprint 2 objective since half of sprint 2 is during midterm week. We'll start working on sprint 2 right away. 

### Sprint 2 objectives:
- Read this tutorial: https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-phpmysql-powered-forum-from-scratch--net-10188
- Create the basic backbone of the Stackoverflow-like website before the 10th of December (Deadline is the 14th. However, this coincide with midterm week and should be avoided) 

### Formatting for branch and issue names
- For this, we will try to set up a neat formatting strategy to help us organise the project in a smart way.

Formatting for name: 
SA1 #[issue number] : [Title of Issue]

Formatting for description : 
Author: [Author of issue]

Description : [Description of what shall be fixed]

- The issue number will be the main identifiers of issues and branches we will be creating.
- This number will help us identify what issue we will be talking about.
